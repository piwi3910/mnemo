Mnemo is your personal knowledge base. Write notes in **Markdown**, link them with [[wiki-links]], and explore your knowledge graph.

## Getting Started

- Create new notes using the sidebar
- Use \`[[double brackets]]\` to link between notes
- Toggle between editor and preview modes
- Try the [[Graph View]] to visualize connections
- Use the search bar to find anything

## Features

- **Markdown Editor** with syntax highlighting
- **Live Preview** rendering
- **Wiki-style Linking** with \`[[note name]]\`
- **Full-text Search** across all notes
- **Graph View** showing connections
- **Dark/Light Mode** following system preference

Check out the [[Projects/Mnemo Roadmap]] for what's coming next!

- [x] Markdown editor with CodeMirror 6
- [x] Live preview
- [x] Wiki-style linking

#project #roadmap
`,

  "Ideas/Knowledge Management.md": `# Knowledge Management

Notes on building a second brain and personal knowledge management systems.

## Key Principles

1. **Capture** — Write everything down
2. **Connect** — Link related ideas with [[wiki-links]]
3. **Create** — Use your notes to produce new work

## Tools Landscape

The space includes tools like:
- Obsidian (local-first, plugin ecosystem)
- Notion (cloud-based, collaborative)
- Roam Research (graph-first)
- **Mnemo** (self-hosted, open source) — see [[Welcome]]

## The Zettelkasten Method

The idea of atomic, interlinked notes goes back to Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten.
Each note should be:
- **Atomic** — One idea per note
- **Autonomous** — Understandable on its own
- **Connected** — Linked to related notes

See the [[Projects/Mnemo Roadmap]] for how we're building this into Mnemo.
